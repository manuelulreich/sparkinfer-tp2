# SP⚡RKINFER · Powered by SN74

**Agentic AI inference. Optimized for every Blackwell GPU.**

A native C++/CUDA runtime for MoE/LLM decoding on Blackwell — from desk-side RTX to workstation
PRO 6000. No Python stack, a **2.5 MB** binary, and Blackwell-native kernels that run **+86%
faster than llama.cpp** on our SOTA model. Continuously optimized by open competition at
**[SN74 on Gittensor](https://gittensor.io/miners/repository?name=gittensor-ai-lab%2Fsparkinfer)**.

> **Fewer models. Deeper optimization. Faster evolution.**

## Run it

One command to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Weights download themselves on first run.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 -v qwen38:/models \
  ghcr.io/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-qwen38:latest
```

Enable DSpark speculative decoding in the API server with one additional argument:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 -v qwen38:/models \
  ghcr.io/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-qwen38:latest serve-dspark
```

The first run downloads both the target and
[`gittensor-model-hub/Qwen3.8-27B-DSpark-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/gittensor-model-hub/Qwen3.8-27B-DSpark-NVFP4)
into the named volume. Startup fails instead of silently serving autoregressively if the drafter
cannot be loaded. It serves a 131,072-token context rather than 262,144: on a 32 GB card the
full-context KV pool leaves no device memory for the drafter. Greedy, plain-text, single-active-request generations use DSpark; requests with
vision, sampling, penalties, logprobs, or an overlapping concurrent request use the lossless
autoregressive path. Inspect `sparkinfer_speculative_runs_total` at `/metrics` to verify use.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "qwen38-nvfp4",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"}]
}'
```

Serves text, **images and video**. ~1 GB image, Blackwell (`sm_120`) only.
Build from source instead: [Quickstart](#quickstart).

**What the endpoint serves**

- **Model id** `qwen38-nvfp4`. `GET /v1/info` reports the live limits.
- **Context** 262,144 tokens, or 131,072 with `serve-dspark`. **Output** up to 16,384 tokens per
  request.
- **Inputs** text, images and video, function tools, `response_format` JSON output, and reasoning on
  or off.
- **APIs** OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses`), Anthropic
  (`/v1/messages`), Ollama (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate`) and LM Studio (`/api/v0/...`).

Change settings with `-e`, for example `-e CTX=65536 -e SPARKINFER_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=32768`, or append
server flags such as `--ctx 65536` after the image name or after `serve-dspark`. See
[container settings](server/README.md#release-container-settings) and
[all server parameters](server/README.md#env).

**Two 16 GB cards.** The 27B does not fit one 16 GB card; add `-e TP=2` and it splits across two
(tensor parallel: half the attention heads, GDN heads, FFN and vocabulary per card):

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 -v qwen38:/models -e TP=2 \
  ghcr.io/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-qwen38:latest            # append serve-dspark for DSpark
```

Measured on 2× RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB (PCIe Gen3 x8, peer-to-peer): 52 tok/s greedy decode, ~2,000 tok/s
prefill at 4k tokens, and DSpark up to 186 tok/s on predictable text — byte-identical to the same
pair's ordinary decode. Context defaults to 131,072 tokens, 49,152 with `serve-dspark` (the card
that holds the drafter has no room for more). The two cards need peer-to-peer access (most
consumer boards provide it through the PCIe root complex; without it the all-reduce falls back to
host staging — still correct, roughly half the link speed), and every all-reduce crosses that
link, so a card pair on a slower slot decodes slower. From source: `--tp 2 --devices 0,1`. The
LMCache sidecar is single-card only and is refused at `--tp 2`. Details:
[server README](server/README.md#serve-on-two-cards---tp-2).

Provenance is attested to the image digest:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-qwen38:latest \
  -R gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer
```

## Qwen3.8-27B — the model we optimize hardest

A dense hybrid Gated-DeltaNet model, and the checkpoint the automated eval scores **every PR**
against. We quantize it in house with NVIDIA ModelOpt for the RTX 5090's FP4 tensor cores:

### 📦 [gittensor-model-hub/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4-RTX5090](https://huggingface.co/gittensor-model-hub/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4-RTX5090)

Uniform NVFP4 on every `Linear`, 17.9 GB, full **262,144-token** context on one 32 GB card.

<!-- BENCH:qwen38-modelopt:start -->

| context | decode | prefill |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | **95.7** tok/s | **6,942** tok/s |
| 4k | **93.6** tok/s | **14,364** tok/s |
| 16k | **90.2** tok/s | **13,794** tok/s |

<sub>Auto-refreshed by the ModelOpt eval bot at `44e1c4505` — these are the numbers that PR measured on the pinned RTX 5090, which after squash-merge are main's. Regenerated on every auto-merge, so the table cannot drift behind the code.</sub>
<!-- BENCH:qwen38-modelopt:end -->

Same weights the model was released with, re-quantized for the hardware it runs on — **+19–22%
decode / +135–179% prefill** over llama.cpp reading its best GGUF. llama.cpp cannot load NVFP4
compressed-tensors at all, so that is *each engine on the format it actually runs*, not a
same-weights benchmark. The same-weights comparison is [below](#same-weights-gguf-on-both-sides),
short-prompt loss included.

[unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4) (NVFP4 FFN + FP8
attention) is equally supported and loads through the same path — 84.9 tok/s decode / 5,031 tok/s
prefill at ctx=128, measured at `d8e1c74`. The eval *scores* PRs on our build and runs a separate
*no-regression guard* on the upstream one, which stops an optimisation winning on one checkpoint
by pessimising the other.

### DSpark speculative decode

Qwen3.8-27B also ships a **DSpark** draft — a five-layer semi-autoregressive block drafter that
proposes a block per step and has the target verify it in one batched pass, so accepting *k*
tokens costs one target forward instead of *k*.

Across contexts, on the committed workload corpus (`bench/scripts/workloads.py`, 128-token
outputs, greedy, batch 1, best of 3), against the autoregressive baseline measured in the same
process and model load:

| | 4K | 16K | 32K |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **mean speedup over AR** | **4.01×** | **2.97×** | **2.63×** |
| AR reference | 91.0 tok/s | 86.4 | 81.3 |

Speculative throughput depends almost entirely on how predictable the generated text is, so a
single number is misleading in either direction. The gated regression check below runs the
*hardest* case — long-context prose at 16k, where acceptance is lowest — and is the figure that
must not regress:

<!-- BENCH:qwen38-dspark:start -->

| context | DSpark decode | AR decode | speedup | mean accepted (τ) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16k | **130.4** tok/s | 88.6 tok/s | **1.472×** | 1.730 |

<sub>**Lossless**: the eval regenerates the same prompt with the draft disabled and requires the two token sequences to be byte-identical, so this is exact-token equality with autoregressive decode, not distributional agreement. A run that is not lossless is rejected regardless of speed.</sub>

<sub>Measured at ctx=16384 on `bench/scripts/bench_prompt_32k.txt`. Speculative throughput depends on how predictable the generated text is — the same build measures a materially different τ on prose, code and repetitive text — so treat this as that workload at that context, not a general serving figure. The AR column is the autoregressive decode measured in the same process, same model load, same GPU state.</sub>

<sub>Auto-refreshed by the DSpark eval bot at `c7a99f6fe` — these are the numbers that PR measured on the pinned RTX 5090, which after squash-merge are main's. Regenerated on every auto-merge, so the table cannot drift behind the code.</sub>
<!-- BENCH:qwen38-dspark:end -->

The two tables measure different corpora, which is the whole point: 4.01× on a mixed workload at
4k and 1.474× on long-context prose at 16k are both true. Quote the range, not a single figure.

Speculation only pays when the verify costs less than what it replaces:
`speedup ≈ τ / (verify cost + draft cost)`, both in target forwards. That is why τ alone is not the
story — a block that accepts more tokens but costs more to verify is slower, and for most of this
feature's life DSpark ran *below* plain AR decode for exactly that reason.

### Same weights, GGUF on both sides

To make the engine comparison fair, the same `Q4_K_M` GGUF
([unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF)) through both engines. RTX 5090,
greedy bs=1, sparkinfer `d8e1c74` vs `llama.cpp d8df12e`:

| context | decode | | prefill | |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| | **SparkInfer** | llama.cpp | **SparkInfer** | llama.cpp |
| 128 | **86.9** (+8.4%) | 80.2 | 2,033 (−26.9%) | **2,782** |
| 4k | **85.2** (+10.6%) | 77.0 | **7,548** (+105.7%) | 3,670 |
| 16k | **82.3** (+11.5%) | 73.9 | **7,596** (+117.2%) | 3,496 |

Prefill crosses over at ~512 tokens. The short-prompt loss is published rather than omitted, and it
has a cause: reading a Q4_K_M GGUF means dequantizing Q4_K into the GEMM operand on every pass, a
fixed cost 128 tokens cannot amortize but 4k easily does. It is a live optimisation target, tracked
by the same automated eval that gates every PR. sparkinfer's own NVFP4 checkpoints do not pay that
dequant and reach 5,031–6,942 pp at the same ctx=128.

## Other models

SparkInfer focuses on the models driving the future of AI — not thousands of legacy architectures.

## Blackwell native

Built for NVIDIA Blackwell from the beginning (`sm_120` + `sm_121`, not datacenter `sm_100`).

| GPU | Arch | Target |
|---|---|---|
| [RTX Spark GB10](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-windows-pcs-agents-rtx-spark) | `sm_121` | Personal AI PC · desk-side agents |
| [DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) | `sm_121` | AI workstation |
| [RTX 5090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5090/) | `sm_120` | Consumer Blackwell · current dev platform |
| [RTX PRO 6000](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/) | `sm_120` | 96 GB workstation · 32k/4k API profile |

Runtime footprint, excluding model weights:

| runtime | size | vs sparkinfer |
|---|---:|---:|
| sparkinfer native binary | **2.5 MB** | 1× |
| llama.cpp CUDA | 80 MB | 33× larger |
| vLLM | 605 MB | 243× larger |

## Powered by SN74 — optimization that never stops

This runtime is not optimized by a team on a roadmap. It is optimized by **open competition**:
contributors submit PRs, a bot verifies correctness and speed on real RTX 5090 hardware, and SN74
rewards **verified marginal speedups**. Every merge has to prove itself on the same GPU.

**15 releases in 3 weeks** — from first llama.cpp beat to +86% decode / +127% prefill @ 32k.

1. Pick a narrow bottleneck in the Blackwell decode path.
2. Submit a PR with source changes and benchmark evidence.
3. The bot builds `main` and the PR on the same RTX 5090.
4. Correctness vs llama.cpp; guards at 128 / 512 / 4k / 16k / 32k decode.
5. Strongest context improvement scores; regressions get `regression-*` labels.
6. Frontier merges; the [dashboard](https://gittensor-ai-lab.github.io/sparkinfer/dashboard/) updates.

Because the benchmark tables above are regenerated on every auto-merge, they cannot drift behind
the code. Miner workflow: [`docs/miner-guide.md`](docs/miner-guide.md).

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1 · Now — fast on every Blackwell edge GPU

*Fastest = cost-effective inference* — more tokens per dollar on Blackwell edge first.

- Qwen3.6 SOTA: **+86%** decode / **+127%** prefill @ 32k vs llama.cpp on RTX 5090
- RTX PRO 6000 — **32k input + 4k output**, full MoE resident
- RTX Spark + DGX Spark `sm_121` bring-up for desk-side agents
- Fastest AI runtime at the edge · desktop app, RAG, memory

### Milestone 2 · Next — trustable AI on confidential compute

Attested builds and sealed execution on PRO 6000 server and B200.

- TDX + NVIDIA CC attestation for `sparkinfer-server` workloads
- Source-verified binaries — same eval loop, inside the enclave
- Privacy guardrails and end-to-end encryption
- Licensed on-prem runtime for regulated enterprise

## Quickstart

Prefer the [Docker image](#run-it). To build and benchmark from source on Blackwell (CUDA 12.8+) —
scripts auto-detect GPU arch, fetch prebuilt binaries or build from source, and download the model:

```bash
# decode throughput (fetches Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M on first run)
bench/scripts/bench.sh --download

# head-to-head vs llama.cpp on the same GGUF + GPU
bench/scripts/bench.sh --download --compare

# accuracy gate — token-match / KL vs llama.cpp
bench/scripts/accuracy.sh --download
```

Your own model: `bench/scripts/bench.sh /path/to/model.gguf --tokens 256`.
Options: [`bench/scripts/README.md`](bench/scripts/README.md).

## Layout & scoring

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| [`kernels/`](kernels) | CUDA kernels — flash-decode, decode GEMV, fused MoE FFN, GEMM, RMSNorm, RoPE, GGUF dequant |
| [`runtime/`](runtime) | scheduler, paged KV cache, CUDA-graph decode, native GGUF loading, model forward |
| [`moe/`](moe) | sync-free MoE router + expert dispatch |
| [`bench/`](bench) | reproducible benchmarks + eval harness |
| [`dashboard/`](dashboard) | static frontier dashboard (GitHub Pages) |
| [`server/`](server) | OpenAI-compatible HTTP API (`BUILD_SERVER=ON`), incl. [image input](docs/image_input.md) |

**Scoring is speedup-only.** SN74 pays verified marginal speedups labeled **XL / L / M / S / XS**. Sub-2% gains are never aggregated across contexts. See [`.gittensor/weights.json`](.gittensor/weights.json).

## Build

Requires **CUDA Toolkit 12.8+** (`sm_120` / `sm_121` codegen).

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120   # or 121 for RTX Spark / Jetson Thor
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build
```

## Automated evaluation

Open a PR — a bot evaluates every ~30 min: source build on RTX 5090, correctness gate vs llama.cpp, no-regression guards, **`eval:<label>`** verdict. The bot **never auto-merges**. Details: [`eval/`](eval) · **[EVAL-TRUST.md](EVAL-TRUST.md)** (Polaris TDX receipts, reproducible from source today).

| label | meaning |
|---|---|
| `XL · L · M · S · XS` | verified speedup over frontier, by % gain |
| `none` | correct, no verified improvement |
| `REJECT` | failed correctness or regression |
| `BASELINE` | first verified frontier entry |
| `<tier>-p` | tier parked by a temporary [noise ban](CONTRIBUTING.md#noise-a-3-day-parked-tier) — earns nothing until the 3 days lift, then restored exactly as measured |
