// Automatic prefix cache for ContinuousBatchEngine.
//
// Chat and agent clients resend the whole conversation on every turn, so each request's prompt is
// the previous request's prompt plus what happened since. Without a cache the server recomputes
// all of it. An entry here is a prefix that was already computed: its KV blocks, shared with any
// later sequence that starts from it (KVCacheManager's refcounted blocks, no copy), and a snapshot
// of the Gated-DeltaNet recurrent state at the end of it.
//
// The snapshot is why an entry is taken at ONE chosen position rather than at every block. KV can
// be cut at any block boundary after the fact, but a recurrent layer's state is a single running
// value -- it exists only at the position the sequence is at, and copying it costs ~205 MB of
// pinned host memory on Qwen3.8-27B. So the engine snapshots each request at a checkpoint the
// caller picks (the server picks the start of the final assistant turn, which is where the next
// turn's prompt stops matching this one), and the cache keeps the most recently used of those.
//
// Every method that touches blocks must run under the model's device mutex, the same lock every
// other KVCacheManager mutation already takes. The cache's own mutex only guards its bookkeeping,
// so stats() can be read from an HTTP thread.
