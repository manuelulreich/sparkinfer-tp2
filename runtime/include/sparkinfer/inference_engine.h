        //    Preprocessing (decode, resize, normalise) is pure CPU and stays with the caller.
        //
        // 2. The embeddings are staged on the SHARED model via set_pending_vision, a single slot
        //    consumed by the next prefill. Only the worker knows which job that is. Staging from
        //    the submitting thread would splice one request's image into another's prefill --
