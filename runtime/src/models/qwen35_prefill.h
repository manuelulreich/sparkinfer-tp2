// head_dim^2 * v_heads block of state it never reads: on Qwen3.8-27B that is 16 of 64 layers, 25% of
// each session's largest buffer -- ~50 MB a session, ~1.65 GB across 33 concurrent requests, which
// is the margin between a 32-row packed step fitting in 32 GB and running out of it.
//
// The layer rule is is_linear_layer()'s: a layer is linear unless (L+1) % full_attn_interval == 0.
// A linear layer's slot is therefore L minus the attention layers before it, L - L/interval, and a
// stack of n layers holds n - n/interval slots. With no interval (a stack that has no linear layers,
// or one gated back to the flag) both fall back to the layer index, i.e. exactly the old layout.
